# Overview

[Visual Studio App Center](https://appcenter.ms/) brings together multiple services commonly used by mobile developers into a DevOps cloud solution. Developers use App Center to Build, Test, and Distribute applications. Once the app's deployed, developers monitor the status and usage of the app using the Analytics and Diagnostics services, and engage with users using the Push service. The following figure highlights the App Center services and how each fits on either side of the DevOps story.

This section describes the basic concepts of App Center and ways to manage your account settings.

## Set up your App Center account

### Apps

You must add an app to your App Center account or receive an invite to someone else's app before getting started with our services. You can have different permission levels for each app: **Developer**, **Viewer**, or **Manager**.

### Organizations

Create an **Organization** to invite **Collaborators** and **Administrators** to work on your apps, and manage their permissions.

### Teams

Create **Teams** within your organization to better manage large organizations and permission settings.

## Manage your account preferences and settings

### Email Notifications

Manage your email preferences to sign up for automatic notifications for builds, distributions, and crashes.

### Bug Tracker Integration

Integrate bug trackers like Jira, Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), Azure DevOps, and GitHub to stay informed when your app crashes.

### Webhooks

Create and enable webhooks to integrate with third party applications you already use.

### Slack App

Install the App Center Slack app to easily trigger builds, monitor your app, and invite new testers directly from Slack.
